# üîó GitHub Pages URL Shortener

This is a minimal URL shortener that can be entirely hosted on GitHub pages. Changes are made upon the original code.

**Warning: I solicited help from GitHub Copilot when modifying the original project for my use.**

Original project is here: [https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener)

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Demo

1. [https://go.karsten.ws/mastodon](https://go.karsten.ws/mastodon) brings you to my mastodon profile.

2. Appending a `?` at the end allows you to preview the destination, a QR code is also displayed for scanning with phone.

3. To prevent unauthorized usage, the script checks for issue by authorized user. An error message will be displayed if unauthorized link is detected.

## ‚òïÔ∏è Features

1. GitHub Issues provide database-esque feature. No reliance on external databases.

2. Minimal deployment difficulty. It's just 2 webpages. You can host it with GitHub Pages or similar services.

3. Editing the original Issue edits the URL. Some short url services charges for this. Insane, right?

## Thanks
This modification is impossible without the help from GitHub user [river](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener/pull/112) and [wmz1024](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener/pull/89)

## Hosting
I host mine on vercel, in order to serve secure headers. You can still host it on GitHub Pages.

## Other Questions
Please check the original project if you have further questions.
