# 🔗 GitHub Pages URL Shortener

This is a minimal URL shortener that can be entirely hosted on GitHub pages. Changes are made upon the original code.

Original project is here: [https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener)

## 👨‍🏫 Demo

1. [https://go.karsten.ws/mastodon](https://go.karsten.ws/mastodon) brings you to my mastodon profile.

2. Appending a `?` at the end allows you to preview the destination, a QR code is also displayed for scanning with phone.

3. To prevent unauthorized usage, the script checks for issue by authorized user. An error message will be displayed if unauthorized link is detected.

## ☕️ Features

1. GitHub Issues provide database-esque feature. No reliance on external databases.

2. Minimal deployment difficulty. It's just 2 webpages. You can host it with GitHub Pages or similar services.

## Hosting
I host mine on vercel, in order to serve secure headers. You can still host it on GitHub Pages.
